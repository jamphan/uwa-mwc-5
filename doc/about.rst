UWA MWC 5
*********

The goal of this project is for students to apply wireless sensor networks
design and implementation skills learned in this unit to design and prototype a
sensor network for a campus-based application. The prototype will be built using
temperature and humidity sensors, 915MHz and LoRa radio transmitters, MQTT or
other gateway technologies, and visualisation tools. Raspberry Pis are available
for groups who wish to use them.

Goals
=====

The task for the project is to design and prototype a sensor network application
for the buildings or grounds of the UWA campus. Each group should choose a
suitable use case for their application. For some ideas see 50 Sensor
Applications for a Smarter World but remember that your project is a prototype
on a much smaller scale than those applications.

Wireless network
================

Your sensor network should be designed for the buildings or grounds of the UWA
campus. Determine node positions and transmitters and test the wireless
channels. It is recommended that your application use a combination of 915 MHz
nodes and LoRa nodes. You should test both these technologies in situ and report
your results as experimental datasets and together with interpretation of the
experiment results for your chosen application. You may also use wireless
channel models and the LoRa simulator (lab week 4) for your design.
