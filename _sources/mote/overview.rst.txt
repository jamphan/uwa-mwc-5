Mote
====

The mote, as of its proof-of-concept stage, is an Arduino based node in a LoRaWAN
wireless sensor network (WSN).

Quickstart
----------

The ``.ino`` file requires installation of the `LoraDraginoCode <https://github.com/websense/LoraDraginoCode>`_ 

Once installed, certain parameters can be tuned in the main ``.ino`` file.
In particular, the sensor identifier and whether or not it is a base station or not

.. code-block:: c

   // Set to 1 if the mote is connected to a RPi base station
   // in which case it will send a Serial frame to the base station
   // which will be sent to the central server
   #define SERIAL_PUSH_TO_LISTENER 1
   
   // Specify the sensor id
   const char *SENSOR_ID = "Lora1";

Once installed, simply copy the ``.ino`` source into the Arduino IDE and compile.
