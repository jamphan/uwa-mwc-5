Listner
=======

The ``Listner`` class is responsible for collecting all messages and writing 
them into storage.

Design
------

The Listener is a multi-thread process, which recieves data from its host's 
serial line, and writes data - either to file, or through a TCP/IP network.

The two core types of threads that the Listener process runs is its main
thread (``Listener``) and a ``Worker`` thread. The ``Listener`` instance handles
all incoming data on the serial line; it's core functions are to:

* Clear the serial recieve buffer to prevent the less powerful serial device 
from overflowing its transmit serial buffer
* Identify if the inbound messages are valid, and if they are
* Put the valid messages into a queue for processing

The ``Worker`` thread reads from the queue and is responsible for;

* Formatting messages into writable forms
* Writing the messages into storage
